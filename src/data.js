    body: `  
        How often are things simply clear and right? 
        Each day we come to moments of despair. 
        Love is something wonderfully there, 
        Even in the blackest hours of night. 
        No one can tell why one of all the rest 
        Makes our flower open to the sun. 
        In truth we could love almost anyone. 
        Choosing, though, does not involve a test. 
        How often does an angel touch our skin, 
        Altering forever who we are? 
        Every passion fades, but love’s a star 
        Lit by holy fires deep within.

    But let me in your heart I promise I will forever hold
    (Us) ..together until our hearts fold ..(together)
    A hearts a home and Love is our household..(Forever)
    So I'ma look you in your beautiful eyes, damn.. What two beautiful life's?

The truth comes up like the sunrise , and
she see's that she was always worth it, 
she was always Perfect. 
When God made Beautiful she must have been handpicked.
 All the Love she ever got from a man was counterfeit. But 
I brought change to that ( I ) rearranged and showed her that all guys ain't the same, but we all stuck in the game. It's a shame,
 I showed her I'm a good guy but she think I'm another lame.
But she not to blame

    title: `EACH TRUTH IS JUST A SCRIM 
    ACROSS THE DARKNESS`,
    body: `
    Each truth is just a scrim across the darkness. 
We cannot see what most we’d like to know. 
We drive among sheer cliffs in pale moonlight 
Unsure of where we are or where to go. 
When we allow our heads to make our choices, 
We lose because of what we cannot see. 
When we give way and let desire take us, 
We lose because we want what cannot be. 
We inch along the dream-lit rocky ridges 
Knowing always, always we must lose. 
The end for all is darkness everlasting, 
And so it matters less which road we choose. 
What matters is the beauty of sheer being; 
The gifts we have and those we will become; 
The ecstasy of loving so completely 
That we ourselves are more than minds can plumb. 
Love well and know that love must end in pain. 
Be a fool and pay the unmarked price. 
Be generous of self, and passion gain: 
One who never loses, loses twice.

    body: `
    How can I know so surely that I’ll love you 
No matter what the future has in store? 
Time is like a cave in which our torches 
Show only the circumference of our minds. 
But love is will far more than it is passion, 
Though passion may at first sustain the will. 
One chooses love the way one chooses faith 
Because that is the way that heaven lies. 
My love for you is vaster than the ocean, 
More rich in loveliness than coral seas. 
I would no more relinquish it than let go 
Willingly the precious gift of life.
